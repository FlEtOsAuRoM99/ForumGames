# ForumGames
Hi evreyone. In this repository I would like to develop my project of Web Technology, a university course, for which I will  mostly use python with the Django package. The project is named "ForumGames" because its goal is to make a site where pc gamers can insert for example fps generated when run and also the components of the computer used.
